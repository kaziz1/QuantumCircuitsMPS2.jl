# Probabilistic Branching API
# ==========================
# 
# This is the finalized probabilistic API using fully named parameters (Style C).
# Selected for: self-documenting code, no position memorization, idiomatic Julia.
#
# For historical context on alternative styles that were considered, see:
# - examples/ct_model_styles.jl (comparison of 4 styles)

# Part of the Probabilistic API (Contract 4.4)

"""
    apply_with_prob!(state; rng=:ctrl, outcomes)

Execute one action from outcomes with fully named parameters.
Probabilities may sum to ≤ 1 (implicit "do nothing" branch for remainder).
Throws error if sum > 1.

Each outcome is a NamedTuple with fields:
- probability: Float64 (required)
- gate: AbstractGate (required)
- geometry: AbstractGeometry (required)

Example:
    apply_with_prob!(state;
        rng = :ctrl,
        outcomes = [
            (probability=p_ctrl, gate=Reset(), geometry=left),
            (probability=1-p_ctrl, gate=HaarRandom(), geometry=right)
        ]
    )

Example (sum < 1):
    apply_with_prob!(state;
        outcomes = [
            (probability=0.3, gate=PauliX(), geometry=site),
            (probability=0.4, gate=PauliY(), geometry=site)
            # 0.3 probability of "do nothing"
        ]
    )
