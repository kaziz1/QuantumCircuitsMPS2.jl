# === Two-Site Spin Sector Operations for S=1 Chains ===
#
# This module provides two distinct operations for AKLT forced measurement:
# 1. SpinSectorProjection: Coherent projection preserving superposition
# 2. SpinSectorMeasurement: Born rule measurement with outcome collapse

"""
    SpinSectorProjection(projector::Matrix{Float64})

Coherent projection onto specified spin sectors (no measurement/collapse).

Applies projector operator P to two adjacent spin-1 sites, then renormalizes:
    |ψ⟩ → P|ψ⟩ / ||P|ψ⟩||

# Example
```julia
# Project onto S=0 and S=1 sectors (remove S=2)
P01 = total_spin_projector(0) + total_spin_projector(1)
gate = SpinSectorProjection(P01)
```

# Physics
This is a coherent operation that preserves quantum superposition.
For AKLT: Repeated application of P₀+P₁ should converge to ground state.

    SpinSectorMeasurement(sectors::Vector{Int}=)

True Born measurement of total spin sector for two adjacent spin-1 sites.

Performs projective measurement that collapses the state to a definite spin sector.
Outcome probabilities follow Born rule: P(S) = ⟨ψ|Pₛ|ψ⟩

# Arguments
- `sectors`: Which sectors to measure (default: [0, 1, 2] for all sectors)

# Example
```julia
# Measure all three sectors
gate = SpinSectorMeasurement([0, 1, 2])

# Measure only S=0 or S=1 (post-select)
gate = SpinSectorMeasurement([0, 1])
```

# Physics
This is the research question: Does forced measurement to S∈{0,1} produce
different physics than coherent projection? Unknown behavior to explore.

# Returns
After application, the measurement outcome S can be retrieved from state history.
