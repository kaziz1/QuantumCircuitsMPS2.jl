    "This tutorial demonstrates the Circuit API workflow for building, visualizing, and simulating quantum circuits in QuantumCircuitsMPS.jl. The Circuit API provides a lazy/symbolic representation that separates circuit construction from execution, enabling visualization and inspection before running expensive simulations.\n",

    "1. **Build**: Circuit created with do-block syntax (lazy/symbolic)\n",
    "2. **Visualize**: SVG diagrams without execution\n",

    "- \u2713 Inspect circuit structure before expensive simulation\n",
    "- \u2713 Reuse same circuit with different initial states\n",
